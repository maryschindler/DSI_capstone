# Part 2: Problem Statement, EDA and Dataset

## Overview

In this section you will update us on your project, including the project you have chosen, your problem statement, an extensive outline of EDA and modeling to date, the goal of your predictive model, and the data you will use to explore that model.

**Your data must be fully in hand by this point OR you must have a solid, achievable plan to do so that has been communicated to your local instructor.**

## Requirements
We expect a formatted and complete Jupyter Notebook by end of class on (see schedule in Course Info Repo), which accomplishes the following:

- Identifies which of the three proposals you outlined in your lightning talk you have chosen
'Posit: In an alternate dimension fans of the band Phish are wealthy and like to gamble. They like to place bets on the probabilities of upcoming setlists. Using all of the bandâ€™s previously played live shows, can we predict an upcoming set list based on the date/location/other inputs.'

- Articulates the main goal of your project (your problem statement)
Problem Statement: Since forming in Burlington, VT in 1983, the band Phish has grown their live-performed song catalogue to over 1200 songs, between their own original numbers and covers. (With such a number of songs to choose from would it be possible to build a predictive model to determine the next setlist that the band may perform.) Supposing that Phish fans, Phishheads, suddenly become wealth and develop a penchant for gambling and that their favorite activity is to bet on upcoming setlists or songs performed, could we develop a predictive model for the next setlist based on the date and location of the performance as well as other inputs. 

Boiled down: Given all of Phish's previously played songs, can we predict which songs will be played next? 

notes: RNN? Learn about this? 

- Outlines your proposed methods and models
Presently I need to clean my data in a way that combines the songs from each show into a 'setlist' in a new 'setlist' column. 
    - Setlist should preserve whether a song was in the first set, second set, encore etc. 
    - My target is going to be the setlist column. At the end I'd like to be able to make predicted setlists. 

- Defines the risks & assumptions of your data
I'm assuming the methods used to obtain the data were in-line with industry norms. The data was collected by a non-profit: 'Phish.net is a non-commercial project run by Phish fans and for Phish fans under the auspices of the all-volunteer, non-profit Mockingbird Foundation.' With a goal of: 'This project serves to compile, preserve, and protect encyclopedic information about Phish and their music.' So I'm assuming the data is appropriate and correct. 

- Revises initial goals & success criteria, as needed
For my X, y training and testing data I need to have:
    - X include the instances of what songs have been played. 
    - y should be the instance of the song played next, the song predicted to be played next. 

- Documents your data source
Phish.net

- Performs & summarizes preliminary EDA of your data


## Formulating your Problem Statement

Your problem statement should the guiding principle for your project.  You can think about this as a "SMART" goal.

- Specific:
  - What precisely do you plan to do?
  - What type of model will you need to develop?
      - RNN??
      
- Measurable:
  - What metrics will you be using to assess performance?
  - MSE? Accuracy? Precision? AUC?
      - Accuaracy
      
- Achievable:
  - Is your project appropriately scoped?
      - Yes!
  
- Relevant:
  - Does anyone care about this?
  - Why should people be interested in your results?
  - What value will the completion of your project be adding?
  
- Time-bound
  - What's your deadline?
      - Yikes! Only about two and a half weeks to go!

- **BAD**: I will model emergency room visits.
- **GOOD**: I will build a regression model to predict the number of daily emergency room visits for St. Someone's Hospital.  Model performance will be guided by RMSE, and the model should at least improve upon baseline by 10%.  Baseline is defined as the monthly average of visits over the last 10 years.

- **BAD**: I will investigate the aftermarket pricing of sneakers.
- **GOOD**: Specific image and text features of sports sneakers are predictive of determinding wether they will sell for more or less in the aftermarket.  The guiding metric will be area under the ROC curve.

---

- **BAD**: I will explore the link between obesity and blood pressure.
- **GOOD**: I will quantify the association between obesity and blood pressure through regression modeling.
- **BETTER**: As obesity increases, how does blood pressure change?
---

- **BAD**: I will predict that sources of news are liberal or conservative.
- **GOOD**:  I will look at text features to understand how news can be classified as liberal or conservative.
- **BETTER**: Specific text feature frequencies can determine the broader category of news sources using classification.  I will describe what makes each class charactitaristically unique, describe what is both certain and uncertain using precision and recall as success metrics.  Then I will conclude with a description of "why" my model describes potential to predict these two categories.

## Data Guidelines

What should you thinking about and looking for as you collect your capstone data?

- Source and format your data
  - Have a way to save data locally (e.g., SQL or CSV), especially if scraping from the web or collecting from an API.
  - Create a data dictionary to accompany your data.
- Perform initial cleaning and munging.
  - Organize your data relevant to your project goals.
  - Write functions to automatically clean and munge data as necessary.
  - Take copious notes, for both others and yourself, describing your assumptions and approach.


## EDA Guidelines

Think about the following as you perform your initial EDA.

- Identify the data types you are working with.
- Examine the distributions of your data, numerically and/or visually.
- Identify outliers.
- Identify missing data and look for patterns of missing data.
- Describe how your EDA will inform your modeling decisions and process.

## Necessary Deliverables / Submission

 Materials must be presented in a Jupyter Notebook stored within a repository on your personal (*not* GA) GitHub. Please submit a link to this repository by the due date [submission link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfc6gVz-mRYxOSwH7EK56UtwQCsnYuJ2rfds_YIdO6D6ewVWQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### BONUS

- Create roadmap of your project with milestones.
- Write a blog post on what you learned from your EDA.
