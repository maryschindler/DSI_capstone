The band was short on equipment, so a hockey stick was used as a microphone stand. Between sets, the DJ spun some Michael Jackson and Trey drummed along to the album. The house music (which included more Michael Jackson) was presumably turned up after Fire to drown out the band. The setlist may be incomplete, though, as the master recording contains nothing after Trey&rsquo;s sarcastic comments about Michael Jackson following Fire. All songs were, of course, Phish debuts. Back in Black was teased before Scarlet Begonias. While this show is often billed as an ROTC Halloween Dance that took place on October 30, 1983, this is incorrect. The master copy of the recording of this show, as unearthed by Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro, contains a handwritten note that pegs the date as December 2, 1983. In discussions with Kevin, band members confirmed that they recall rehearsing for this show over the Thanksgiving Break, and that the show was a Christmas semi-formal. Also, it was not an ROTC-sponsored event; it was a dorm dance in a predominantly ROTC dorm (Mike&rsquo;s dorm at the time).",Harris-Millis Cafeteria - University of Vermont,Burlington,VT,USA,Phish,1,1983 Tour,"['Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress', 'Proud Mary', 'In the Midnight Hour', 'Squeeze Box', 'Roadhouse Blues', 'Happy Birthday to You', 'Scarlet Begonias', 'Fire on the Mountain']"

Fish was introduced as 'Soda Jerk' during I Didnt Know. Split Open and Melt and Disease were unfinished. Melt contained A Love Supreme teases. After the ensuing Catapult, Trey remarked: Only at the largest concert in the world could we get away with playing a song like that. After Midnight made its Phish debut. The late set, also known as The Show, began at around 11:35. Father Time was on stage, pedaling on an exercise bike that powered a large clock. The sounds of the clocks gears could be heard through the sound system. About ten minutes before midnight, Father Time collapsed from exhaustion and the clock stopped. Then, a large fan boat entered the concert field and approached the stage. Early in its journey, the fan boat exploded away and revealed the hot dog used in the 1994 New Years stunt. While the band rode the hot dog to the stage, an instrumental version of Meatstick began to play over the P.A.. The band reached the stage and fed several meatsticks to Father Time, reviving him so that the clock could continue moving toward midnight. The band then took the stage and played Meatstick to begin The Show. Dancers were on stage prior to Phish reaching it. Auld Lang Syne and Disease were accompanied by fireworks. Heavy Things was recorded live and rebroadcast as part of ABC televisions New Years Eve coverage. In a humorous effort to confuse the home audience, Trey instructed the crowd to yell the word cheesecake in lieu of cheering at the end of the song. After twice giving the example of yelling the word once, Trey changed his mind and instructed the crowd to chant it, adding for them to say it like they were pissed. Trey then introduced the band for the rebroadcast and offered a message of peace and harmony for the world where he reminded people to drive in the right lane unless passing another vehicle. Meatstick was subsequently teased as the New Year approached in the central time zone. YEM included a vocal jam based around the word cheesecake and Trey altered the lyrics to Axilla and Albuquerque to reference the word. Inlaw Josie Wales featured Trey on acoustic guitar. Quadrophonic Toppling debuted, albeit with different music than on <em>The Siket Disc, </em>and included My Soul teasing from Mike. Rock and Roll included an After Midnight tease. Love You included band introductions; Fish introduced Page before the song and Mike and Trey afterwards, and the band as Phish 2000 (see November 2, 1990). Piper contained Bug teases from Page. 2001 began with the signature Hood drum roll. After the show closed with yet another version of Meatstick, the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun was piped through the crowd at sunrise. Two breakouts were played: Crosseyed and Painless (first since August 13, 1997, or 159 shows), and Love You (first since July 5, 1997, or 179 shows).",Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation,Big Cypress,FL,USA,Phish,61,Not Part of a Tour,"['Runaway Jim', 'Funky Bitch', 'Tube', ""I Didn't Know"", 'Punch You in the Eye', 'Bouncing Around the Room', 'Poor Heart', 'Roggae', 'Split Open and Melt', 'Catapult', 'Back on the Train', 'Horn', 'Guyute', 'After Midnight', 'Meatstick', 'Auld Lang Syne', 'Down with Disease', 'Llama', 'Bathtub Gin', 'Heavy Things', 'Twist', 'Prince Caspian', 'Rock and Roll', 'You Enjoy Myself', 'Crosseyed and Painless', 'The Inlaw Josie Wales', 'Sand', 'Quadrophonic Toppling', 'Slave to the Traffic Light', 'Albuquerque', 'Reba', 'Axilla', 'Uncle Pen', 'David Bowie', 'My Soul', 'Drowned', 'After Midnight', 'The Horse', 'Silent in the Morning', 'Bittersweet Motel', 'Piper', 'Free', 'Lawn Boy', 'Hold Your Head Up', 'Love You', 'Hold Your Head Up', 'Roses Are Free', 'Bug', 'Also Sprach Zarathustra', 'Wading in the Velvet Sea', 'Meatstick']"

Prior to the third set, a pedestal stating 2010 was placed on the front of the stage and a covered structure was placed behind Fish&#39;s drumset. During DWD, as the clock turned midnight, hundreds of balloons were released upon the crowd, fireworks went off on each side of the stage, and a disco ball was lowered onto the pedestal. After DWD, Trey opened the ball and Fish&nbsp;climbed inside. Trey and Mike, with some help from stagehands, proceeded to put the ball in a giant cannon aimed towards a giant net hanging from the rafters with an illuminated &ldquo;X&rdquo; on it. Page hit the trigger and purportedly &quot;blasted&quot; the ball through, not only the net, but also the roof of the arena. A searchlight appeared to come through the roof and was accompanied by helicopter sounds. With Fish&nbsp;apparently shot out of the venue, Trey asked if anybody knew how to play the drums and ended up finding Sarah, a girl from Pittsburgh. Trey asked how long she had played the drums and what her favorite song was and she responded with six months and Fluffhead respectively. Sarah was surreptitiously replaced by Fish, now wearing a dress identical to Sarah&#39;s and a black wig, who played the entire third set and encore, but Sarah came out at the end of the third set and bowed with the band instead of him. Blue Moon was a Phish debut and was performed as an instrumental while Trey thanked the entire crew. After the show, the disco ball was revealed to have &quot;crashed&quot; into a white car that had been parked in front of the American Airlines Arena with a sign on the windshield stating &quot;This car was driven down from Vermont&quot; and &quot;fueled by maple syrup.&quot; &nbsp;After being &ldquo;struck&rdquo; by the &ldquo;human cannonball,&rdquo; the car was emitting smoke and leaking maple syrup and the entire area was cordoned off with police tape.&nbsp;",American Airlines Arena,Miami,FL,USA,Phish,67,2009 NYE Run,"['AC/DC Bag', '46 Days', 'Water in the Sky', 'Bathtub Gin', 'Punch You in the Eye', 'The Moma Dance', 'Guyute', 'Swept Away', 'Steep', 'Demand', 'Seven Below', 'Lawn Boy', 'Julius', 'Rock and Roll', 'Piper', 'Simple', 'Theme From the Bottom', 'Shine a Light', 'Ghost', 'NO2', 'Suzy Greenberg', 'Party Time', 'Auld Lang Syne', 'Down with Disease', 'Fluffhead', 'Joy', 'The Squirming Coil', 'You Enjoy Myself', 'Blue Moon', 'Loving Cup']"

After Timber, Trey sang the ending notes to Brother. Trey then said he had a trivia question for the crowd and asked &quot;how many songs end like this?&quot; and the band sang the ending of Brother again. He answered the question by saying the songs were My Friend, My Friend, Rift, and Brother (all of which had their endings &quot;sung&quot;). Trey added that tonight was special because from now on, Timber would also end with the Brother ending (which was sung again). Trey said Page could also end Lawn Boy that way from now on, prompting a Lawn Boy quote from Page. Mike then teased Ha Ha Ha. Trey went on to say that Metallica would be playing at Bader Field soon after Phish and that he didn&#39;t think they ended a single song like the ending of Brother (Trey sang the ending). Trey said if everyone wrote Metallica a note saying &quot;Dear Metallica, please end Master of Puppets like this&quot; (singing the ending one final time), if they got 20,000 notes, they just might do it.
